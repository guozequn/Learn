# 1. Every If-statement must have an else

# 2. If these else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that
# prints out an error message and dies , jusst like we did in the last exercise, This will find many errors.

# 3. Never nest if-statement more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.


# 4. Treat if-statement like paragraphs where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines
#  before and after.

# 5. Your Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your
# function and yse a good name for the variable .


# If you follow these simple rules, you will start writing better code than most programers . Go back to the last
# exercise and see if I followed all of these rules. If not fix my mistakes.
